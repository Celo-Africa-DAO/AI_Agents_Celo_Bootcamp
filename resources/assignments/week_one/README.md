# Week 1 Assignment: Create Your First AI Agent using Eliza (Fleek)

Welcome to Week 1! 🎉
In this assignment, you’ll create your first AI Agent using [Eliza’s Fleek interface](https://fleek.xyz/eliza), leveraging the “Start with a template” option to quickly scaffold your agent.

## Goal
* Understand the core structure of an AI Agent on Eliza.
* Deploy your first AI Agent via Fleek’s no-code/low-code interface.


## Steps
## 1. Go to Eliza on Fleek
* Go to [fleek's site](https://fleek.xyz/eliza)
* You should see the Get Started screen with 3 options:
  * Upload characterfile
  * Build from scratch
  * ✅ Start with a template → Click this one

## 2. Choose a Template

* You’ll be prompted with a list of predefined character templates
* 	Pick one that fits your curiosity — or just explore!
* Examples: Helpful assistant, quirky friend etc!

## 3. Customize this Template

* Update fields like:
    * **Agent Name** (e.g., BananaBot, ZenFox, SassyGPT)
    * **Personality Traits:** Is it kind? Curious? Snarky?
    * **Goals:** What’s its purpose? Make jokes? Motivate you? Give bad advice?

## 4. Save and Run
* Once you’re happy:
  * Click **Deploy** or **Save & Run**
  * You’ll be redirected to an interface where you can start chatting with your agent

Boom! You’ve created your first AI agent! 💥

## 5. Record Your Demo Video 🎥
* Use Loom, Screenity, or any screen recorder to record:
  * A short video (1–2 mins max)
  * Show your agent running
  * Type a few messages and show its replies
  * You can upload it to youtube (public or unlisted) to get a shareable link

## 6. Submit your video via GitHub 🧑‍💻
📁 Submission Process
